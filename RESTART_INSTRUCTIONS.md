# Firebase Setup - Restart Required

The Firebase environment variables have been configured in `.env.local`, but you need to restart your Next.js development server for them to take effect.

## Steps to fix:

1. **Stop your current development server** (if running):
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running

2. **Start the development server again**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check the browser console** for the debug message showing which Firebase config values are loaded

## Your Firebase credentials are set up:
- Project ID: `surfaceguard-365-cad2s`
- All environment variables are in `.env.local`

## For Netlify deployment:
Remember to add all the environment variables from `FIREBASE_ENV_SETUP.md` to your Netlify site settings.
